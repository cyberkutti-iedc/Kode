## ✅ Short-Term Goals (v0.1.x)

- [x] **Bytecode Compilation**: Compile `.kode` to `.kdc` using `bincode`
- [x] **REPL Improvements**: Enhanced interactive environment with better error reporting
- [x] **Closures and Arrays**: Support for first-class functions and array data structures
- [x] **Error Handling**: Implement `try/catch` for basic error recovery
- [x] **Module System**: Support for `import` to use code from other files
- [ ] **Standard Library**: Begin implementation of core utility functions
- [ ] **Documentation**: Complete language reference and examples
- [ ] **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite for the interpreter

---

## 🚧 Mid-Term Goals (v0.2.x)

- [ ] **Native Code Generation**: Add initial support in `codegen.rs`
- [ ] **Static Type Checking**: Optional type hints and basic validation
- [ ] **Standard Library Implementation**: Comprehensive built-in functions
- [ ] **Enhanced Loops**: Improved `for` loop syntax with iterators
- [ ] **Tracebacks**: Better runtime error messages with call stacks
- [ ] **Debugging Support**: Basic debugger integration
- [ ] **Performance Optimizations**: Faster bytecode execution
- [ ] **String Interpolation**: Template strings with embedded expressions
- [ ] **VS Code Extension**: Syntax highlighting and editor integration

---

## 🧠 Long-Term Goals (v1.0+)

- [ ] **Package/Module System**: Full namespace support and versioning
- [ ] **Package Manager**: Introduce `kodepkg` for dependency management
- [ ] **Asynchronous Programming**: Support for `async`/`await` syntax
- [ ] **Advanced Data Structures**: Maps, sets, and custom types
- [ ] **Function Overloading**: Multiple function implementations based on parameters
- [ ] **Pattern Matching**: Advanced control flow with destructuring
- [ ] **JIT Compilation**: Just-in-time compilation for performance
- [ ] **Foreign Function Interface**: Interoperability with C/Rust libraries
- [ ] **Meta-programming**: Macros and compile-time code generation
- [ ] **Object System**: Lightweight class-like constructs

---

## 📦 Ecosystem Expansion

- [ ] **Web Playground**: Browser-based WASM interpreter
- [ ] **Documentation Site**: Comprehensive language reference
- [ ] **Learning Resources**: Tutorials and example projects
- [ ] **Community Forum**: Discussion space for users and contributors
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: Testing and deployment workflows
- [ ] **Benchmarking Suite**: Performance measurement tools
