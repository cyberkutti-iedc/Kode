> A modern, interpretable programming language with C-style syntax and functional capabilities

**Created by Sreeraj V Rajesh**

## 📋 Overview

Kode is a lightweight, interpreted programming language designed with readability and simplicity in mind. It features a clean C-like syntax with influences from JavaScript, Python, and Rust, making it approachable for developers from various backgrounds.

### Key Features

- **Familiar Syntax**: C-style syntax that feels natural to most programmers
- **Dynamic Typing**: Flexible variable handling without type declarations
- **First-Class Functions**: Supports closures and function passing
- **Bytecode Compilation**: Compile to `.kdc` bytecode for faster execution
- **Interactive REPL**: Experiment with code in real-time
- **Module System**: Import and use code from other files
- **Error Handling**: Built-in try/catch mechanism
